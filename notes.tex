\section{Atom Fundamentals}
\subsection{Description}
Atoms\index{atom} are considered the smallest units of ordinary matter with the
properties of a chemical element and are defined in terms of their constituing
parts - neutrons, protons and electrons.

\subsection{Composition}
Atoms are composed of a nucleus and negatively charged electrons which are
bound to the nucleus through its electromagnetic force.
Nucleons, which are either positively charged protons or neutral neutrons,
make up the nucleus of an atom.

An atom's composition will determine among other things, the charge, weight and
type of atom.

\subsubsection{Type}
For a given element, all atoms will contain a fixed number of protons in its
nucleus.
This number of protons in an atom - commonly referred to as the atomic number
\index{atomic number} $Z$ - uniquely identifies the atom's type and forms the
basis for the organization of elements as familiarized through the period table
of elements.

Carbon is the element defined by six protons in its nucleus and is represented
as \ce{_6}C. Since the atomic number is unique to the element one may omit the
atomic number in notation and represent carbon simply as \ce{}C without
impairing clarity, however; in this text the convention is held to present the
atomic number of an element regardless how redundant\footnote{Representing the
atomic number along with the element eliminates the need to lookup an element's
atomic number when not acquainted with a particial element}.

\subsubsection{Isotopes}
The number of protons for a given element are fixed, however; the number of
neutrons found within a nucleus i.e.\ neutron number $N$ of an element may vary
depending on the isotope of the element.

The atomic mass number $A$, also known as the mass number or nucleon number,
represents the number of nucleons in an atom and is essentially the sum of
neutrons $N$ and protons $Z$.

$$A = N + Z$$

Carbon's most common isotope -  carbon-12 (\ce{^{12}_{6}}C) - has an
atomic mass number of 12 ($A = 12$) with an atomic number of 6 ($Z = 6$)
leading to the conclusion that the carbon-12 isotope contains $N=A-Z=12-6$
neutrons.

In the case of carbon, 3 isotopes \ce{^{12}_{6}}C, \ce{^{13}_{6}}C and
\ce{^{14}_{6}}C are found naturally with the atomic number of 6 and the
respective atomic mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14.

\subsection{Charge}

Electrons and protons determine the electric charge of an atom. Electrons
exhibit a negative charge \SI{-1}{\elementarycharge}, while protons exhibit a
positive charge \SI{1}{\elementarycharge}.

A neutral atom contains an equal number of electrons to protons, while an ion
contains an imbalance between electrons to protons resulting to non-zero charge.
In the case of a net positive charge, an atom is referred to as a
cation\index{cation}, while an atom with a net negative charge is referred to
as an anion\index{anion}.

Creation of an ion is accomplished through chemical or physical means through
a process referred to as ionization.

\subsection{Behavior}
Atoms, typically sized around \SI{100}{\pico\meter}, are so small that
classical physics fails to accurately describe their behavior due to quantum
effects.

\subsection{Mass and Weight}
The colloquial usage of the term ``weight'' is technically incorrect as the
intent is actually to use the term ``mass''.

In physics mass is measured in grams (\si{\gram}) while weight is measured in
Newtons (\si{\newton}).
Weight\index{weight} $W = m\cdot g$ represents the force on a mass due to
gravity, as such weight is very dependent on the gravitational pull that a
mass is subjected to.
The accelleration of an object due to its subjection to a gravitational pull is
referred to as gravity\index{gravity} $g = a_g = \frac{v}{t} = \frac{d}{t^2}$
which, on the surface of Earth, results to an earthbound acceleration of about
\SI{9.8}{\meter\second^{-2}}.

In chemistry mass is expressed in atomic mass units (\si{\atomicmassunit}) or
Daltons (\si{\dalton}).

Atomic mass units\index{atomic mass unit} have been standardized to the new
unit \si{\atomicmassunit} or \si{\dalton} in 1961 to refer to the mass of
\ce{^{12}}C in order to address the complication and confusion caused by
chemists and physicists upholding different standards
\footnote{Within Chemistry naturally ocurring oxygen (including the heavier
\ce{^{17}}O and \ce{^{18}}O) were considered as a reference for 16 atomic mass
units whereas in Physics the pure isotopic \ce{^{16}}O was considered the
reference for the same 16 atomic mass units, accounting for a difference of
\num{1.000282} at times between the two fields.} for atomic mass units (amu)
prior.

$$\mathrm {u} =m_{\mathrm {u} }={\frac {1}{12}} m_a(\mathrm{ \ce{^{12}}C })$$

Quarks are elementary particles that combine to form composite particles called
hadrons, of which protons and neutrons are the most stable. Hadrons are held
together by the strong force and can be classified into baryons, which are
composed of 3 quarks and mesons which are composed of one quark and antiquark.

Protons and neutrons are baryons and therefore participate in the strong
interaction.

The mass of an atom is largely determined by baryons as is most of the mass
in the visible universe. The rest masses of a quark inside a proton baryon
contribute to about a percent of the weight of a proton while the quantum
chromodynamics binding energy, which includes the kinetic energy of the quarks
and the energy of the gluon fields that bind the quarks together, determines
the remaining bulk of the mass.

Both protons and neutrons have a mass close to a single atomic mass unit.

%Electrons, being leptons of the charged variety, do not undergo strong
%interactions

Since atoms operate at a quantum level, they are subjected to dynamics that
are predominantly dictated by forces other than gravitational force.
Postulating the notion of ``weight'' in a classical mechanical sense
is somewhat of a futile exercise, therefore relative atomic weight is a
unitless quantity defined by the weighted average of the atomic mass of the
different isotopes for an element, by abundance.

For a given isotope $i$ of element $\mathrm E$ in material $P$, one can
calculate the atomic weight in reference to the atomic mass of \ce{^{12}_{6}}C
as represented by equation \ref{eq:atomicweightforisotope}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:atomicweightforisotope}
  A_r(\mathrm { \ce{^i}E })_P =
  \frac{ m_a(\mathrm { \ce{^i}E })_P }{ m_a(\mathrm { \ce{^{12}}C })/12 } =
  \frac{ m_a(\mathrm { \ce{^i}E })_P }{ \si{\dalton} }
\end{equation}

Determining the atomic weight for element $\mathrm E$ in material $P$,
$A_r(\mathrm E)_P$, demands the factoring of the isotopic abundance
$x(\mathrm { \ce{^{i}E} })_P$ and the atomic weight of the given isotope
$A_r(\mathrm { \ce{^i}E })_P$.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:atomicweightforelement}
  A_r(\mathrm E)_P =
  \sum [x(\mathrm { \ce{^i}E })_P \times A_r( \mathrm { \ce{^i}E } )_P]
\end{equation}

The standard atomic weight of carbon is \num{12.011}\cite{atomic-weights-2013},
a value that is closer to \num{12} than \num{13} or \num{14} suggesting that
\ce{^{12}_{6}}C is the more abundant or common isotope of carbon found in
normal terrestrial materials.
